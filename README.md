BOcT is a Static Browser Chatbot, made with JavaScript. It's currently in Early development stages

New Feature: BOcT can now convert units

Also, Available as Progressive Web App (PWA)

Future Updates to BOcT can make it perform basic Maths, Maybe suggest you some Movies...

98% Self-Made. Also, This is my Self-Learning JavaScript Project (learning from MDN)

Note: This is Over-Polished;
